The purpose of this website is to help people find their pets where they are lost, help people find the pets' owner,
connect people who cares about animals, and draw attention of people about strayed animals that are living in the same community.

To achieve the above goals, Pawmark's database stores the information of animals, including pets/ strayed dogs and cats. Contact informations of owners
are also stored.

Users are allowed to register an account, input their contact details and their pets' information. Then they are able to
use these keywords to search for users or animals. Users' profiles are connected to their pets and users can find owner's contact details from
pets' profiles.

Users can update their own information, add, update or delete their pets' information.
